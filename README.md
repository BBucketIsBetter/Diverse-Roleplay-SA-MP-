# Diverse-Roleplay-SA-MP-
A feature-filled, neat, but poorky-written SA:MP script.

- [x] Added HasInvItem(playerid, itemid, amount), this function returns the slot to prevent item duplication during crack cooking.
- [x] More improvements to ban evasion detection. (We're as good as SA:MP will allow unless we want to start making assumptions that can lead to false-positives.)
- [x] Re-wrote and added /forbid /unforbid this time it actually saves and doesn't use 'GetPVarInt' in OnPlayerUpdate.
- [x] Further optimizations to OnPlayerUpdate. Moved some things out of OnPlayerUpdate that didn't need to be there.
- [x] Fixed an issue where /putgun would run the player-save operation before removing your weapon. (So lets say you /pg then the server restarts, you'd have he gun in your inventory AND in your hand.)

- [x] Redid vehicle ELM.

- [ ] Baitcar system.
- [ ] Set the players velocity to 0 when using a swat-rope and manually lower them to the ground using a timer, or even OnPlayerUpdate.
